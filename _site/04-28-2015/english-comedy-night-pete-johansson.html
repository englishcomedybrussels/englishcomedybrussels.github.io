        <p>Dear comedy lovers, we have an amazing lineup for our April show, with headliner Pete Johansson, who did an incredible performance last year at &#39;Just For Laughs&quot; in Brussels.</p>

<p>Pete Johansson (Canada) is a UK-based comic from Canada who performs all over the world. He gigs regularly in The Comedy Store, Glee Clubs, Komedia, Highlights and The Stands in the UK. He’s also a familiar face on the Canadian and European scene. Pete has performed in the Middle East and Australia, and travels around the world finding new and exciting gigs to play.</p>

<p>Jørund Larsen (NOR) has been performing stand-up comedy since 2007 and has performed in venues such as Latter (Oslo), Norra Brunn (Stockholm) and Comedy Zoo (Copenhagen). He has also performed at the Copenhagen and Utrecht Comedy Festivals, and three times at the Lund Comedy Festival. In his daily job, Jørund works with IT and risks losing his job almost on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Jamali Maddix (GB) won the 2014 Chortle student comedian award. He did a great performance last January and we are very happy to have him back in Brussels.</p>

<p>Valdemar Pustelnik (DK) is one of the leading danish alternative comedians, and he presents a show that is a mixture of surreal storytelling, audience interaction and the preaching of his own moral code. It is an absurdist confessional stand-up show, about getting older, politics and the responsibility of life.</p>

	We are delighted to welcome comedy superstar&nbsp;<strong>Simon Brodkin</strong> to Brussels on Tuesday november the 15th at Bouche-à-Oreille theatre.</p>
<p style="margin-left:36pt;">
<em>Acclaimed character comedian and “<strong>the world’s most famous blagger</strong>” (The Daily Telegraph). Simon is now performing as himself and sold out multiple UK tours.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left:36pt;">
<em><strong>Star of Britain’s Greatest Hoaxer</strong> (Channel 4) Simon hit global headlines multiple times for his high-profile stunts, including handing Theresa May a P45 during her speech at the Conservative Party Conference, showering disgraced FIFA president Sepp Blatter with bank notes, surrounding Donald Trump at the opening of his golf courses with 60 swastika-emblazoned golf balls, attaching a 25-foot sign to the side of Sir Philip Green’s super yacht, and going on Britain’s Got Talent as the ultra-orthodox Jewish rapper Steven Goldblatt – fooling Simon Cowell and the other judges to win four ‘yeses’. <strong>Britain’s Greatest Hoaxer was nominated for best Documentary at the Monte Carlo TV Festival Golden Nymph Awards 2018</strong>.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left:36pt;">
<em>Simon’s most famous character is “comedy legend” (The Sun) Lee Nelson, writing and staring in two series of BBC Three’s ratings smash Lee Nelson’s Well Good Show and the sketch series Lee Nelson’s Well Funny People, which introduced the nation to a plethora of brilliant characters.</em></p>

For the first time we have a ladies' special with two well established british female comedians:

### Angela Barnes
She has won the 2011 BBC New Comedy Award and became a finalist at the 2011 Latitude Festival New Act of the Year competition. Since 2011, Angela and her witty world view have been catapulted onto numerous radio and television shows including appearances on BBC Three's Russell Howard's Good News, Russell Kane's Whistle Stop Tour (BBC Radio 2), and BBC Radio 4's The Now Show.

“Brilliantly funny” &mdash; *Sarah Millican*

“She's just a gloriously down-to-earth, straight talking and extremely funny comic” &mdash; *The Guardian*

“Angela Barnes is the best mainstream female comedian I've seen since Sarah Millican… I can't be any clearer than that can I?” &mdash; *Bruce Dessau, Evening Standard critic*

### Jen Brister
A regular performer on the UK & International circuit, she has also written for BBC Scotland and presented for BBC6 Music.

After a hugely successful tour of her show ‘British(ish)' at the Adelaide Fringe, Melbourne Comedy Festival and Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2011, Jen took her new show, ‘Now & Then' on tour the next year to Australia/Asia before showcasing it once more at the Edinburgh Fringe in August. She finished with a sell out run at London's Soho Theatre. She also starred in Russell Brand & Trevor Lock's ‘Cloud Cuckoo Land' on BBC Radio 2.

Jen debuted her current show, ‘Wishful Thinking' at the Melbourne Comedy Festival in March to critical acclaim and took it to the Edinburgh Fringe in August for a full run. Recently, she appeared on 2 episodes of ‘Comedy Central Live at the Comedy Store'.

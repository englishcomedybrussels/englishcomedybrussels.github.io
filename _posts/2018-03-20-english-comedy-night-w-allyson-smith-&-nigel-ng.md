Allyson Smith returns to Brussels!  She's one of our crowd's favorites.  And together with her, for the first time in Belgium, Nigel NG, check them out!

## Nigel NG

Nigel Ng grew up in Malaysia, lived in America for five years and moved to the UK in 2015. Having started his comedy career in Chicago, he’s relieved that (most) people in the UK get his jokes too, as evidenced by him winning the prestigious Amused Moose Laugh Off 2016 and being runner up in the Laughing Horse New Act of the Year 2015.

Nigel was the winner of the Amused Moose Comedy Laugh Off 2016 and the finalist of many other prestigious comedy competitions such as Laughing Horse New Act of the Year 2015, Leicester Mercury Comedian of the Year 2016 and Leicester Square New Comedian of the Year 2015.

His combination of laid back likability and sharp observations are sure to get him far.

He was also a finalist in the Leicester Mercury Comedian of the Year (2016) and Leicester Square New Comedian of the Year (2015) competitions, and now can be seen performing in comedy clubs across the UK.

‘Natural funnybones…as slick as they come’ – Chortle

‘Plenty of good lines… keen observer’ – beyondthejoke.co.uk

‘Top notch… oozed likability and the audience loved him from the word go… stole the show’ – The Stand

## Allyson Smith

Since 2000, Allyson June Smith has been tickling Canada’s comedy scene from the moment she put down the chalk brush and picked up a mic.

Playing to packed rooms has become like another day in the classroom for this former school teacher.

Her credits include her own hour long Comedy Now special, appearances on CBC Radio’s hit show The Debaters, and the Winnipeg, Halifax and Just For Laughs Festivals, to name just a few. A multiple Canadian Comedy Award nominee for Best Female Stand-Up, she performs for audiences ranging from corporations to the most rural of gatherings. Whether she was the emcee, support, or headliner, she's delighted them all.

After working her way across Canada, Allyson now has taken her craft to the UK. Using her sassy blend of in-your-face stand-up and hilariously insightful commentary, she now works for major UK promoters and comedy clubs.

It is her genuine and unique sense of humor, combined with excellent performance timing, that has made audiences augh. This teacher-come-comic is ready to show international audiences why she is a sought-after fan favourite.

Doors open at 6:30 pm, come early and enjoy some great food and spectacular Gin & Tonics!

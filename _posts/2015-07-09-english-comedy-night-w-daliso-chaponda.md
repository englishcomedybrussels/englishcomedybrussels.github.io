Daliso Chaponda is back !! We had the privilege of having this amazing comedian in June 2014. He was so good we needed him back, so there we are !

### Daliso Chaponda (Mw)
Daliso began his comedy career in Canada with the acclaimed one man show ‘Feed This Black Man’. He then toured South Africa for 6 months before moving to England.

*"One of the finest, funniest and most fair-minded comic commentators on race and post-colonial integration that I have seen"* &mdash; Three Weeks, SCOTLAND

*"Full of extravagant gestures and impassioned speeches. He inspires whoops and cheers from his watchers. Highly recommended"* &mdash; BBC Tees, ENGLAND

*"A stand up comedian with raw Eddie Murphy confidence, cheek and super-polished style"* &mdash; Nerve, ENGLAND

### Archie Maddocks (GB)
He’s an exciting and award winning Stand Up Comedian, who is armed with a natural stage presence, and a “winning smile”. He possesses an affable and likeable nature that immediately puts people at ease and has impressed both his peers and audiences with his charismatic, conversational style, hilarious observations and quick, acerbic wit.

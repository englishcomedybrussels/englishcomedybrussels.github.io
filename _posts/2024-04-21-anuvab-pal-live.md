<h2>Anuvab Pal Live</h2>

Anuvab Pal brings his comedic observations to Brussels about an Indian man's quest to understand Europe. It's ridiculous, it is baffling, it is definitely silly…He will explain in detail why Indians should embrace the western world, having done it himself.  

The New York Times calls Anuvab Pal 'India's Most Intelligent Comedian’. 

The BBC call him India’s answer to British Wit. 

As seen and on Amazon Prime, QI and the Big Asian Stand-up (BBC).

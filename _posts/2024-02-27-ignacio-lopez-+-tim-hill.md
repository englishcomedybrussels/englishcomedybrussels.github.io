Ignacio has performed for the Wales football squad, opened for James Dean Bradfield of Manic Street Preachers, and hosts comedy and corporate events around the World. At last count Ignacio's videos have received over 20 Million views in total across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. </span></p>

<span>Special guest :</span></p>
<p>
<span><strong>Tim Hill</strong></span></p>
<p>
<span>Tim Hill is a recovering cynic. A backpacker who settled down to become a dad. A sweet guy with a sting in his tail. But above all, a smartass who loves referring to himself in the third person (he really does). Tim does not approve of people calling him a hipster – meaning he probably is one – and sees the world as a meaningless yet endlessly fascinating place. Tim is cheap, clean and sustainable and is therefore considered by many to be a viable alternative to fossil fuels.</span></p>
